sorrow vanished a minute later.

While the White House did not comment on any specific investigations into the incident, Fox News reports that "the administration has begun moving more cautiously to address the issue" because the White House already feels the FBI is investigating the White House "in a manner that minimizes the potential for conflicts of interest."

"When an administration of which President is president may want their power to come up from outside to conduct investigations so as not to become involved with the political process — or as required by law — where are they going to go out of touch with the political process?"

One member of Congress is pushing for greater transparency by allowing "unreliable, verifiable sources" to come in and out of the government's "blackbox accounts or files" to testify about the president's contacts with foreign and domestic entities during his tenure. The legislation also would help a former special prosecutor, Michael Turner, open some legal cases and provide a "credible avenue for the government to investigate possible obstruction of justice."

Former FBI Director James Comey has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his meetings with Russian officials during the transition to the presidency, as well as his personal travel to Russia and what his staff told him about the investigation.

"It's a political witch hunt, not a serious matter," he told NBC's Chuck Todd on Monday.
