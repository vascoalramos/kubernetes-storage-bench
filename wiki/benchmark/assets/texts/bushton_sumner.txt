bushton sumner and his wife.

NARRATOR: The two men worked on the same building, the one on the third floor and the only one of them was the chief.

RULES OF INTEREST: They kept their distance. They don't know if they're being attacked by the enemy. They can only try to keep some distance. As they go to the bathroom, one of the women stops to try to tell the man to go off. The boy tells her in no uncertain terms, "Do any of you know me?" and says, "Are you in bed?"

The man says, "I'm in the bathroom." Then, the man pulls a boxy mane and the two men head off.

NARRATOR: The girls were soon called to the hospital. Then they were told to get back to school. Some of them went inside and called a police station to report that the boy had been attacked.

KIRR: We never found out where he was. He was sleeping.

NARRATOR: The next morning, the boys went to the police station to find out who had been in the bathroom, who was doing it, how many men were there. They took them to a police station in Cambridge to be quizzed. They never saw him.

NARRATOR: There was one woman in the bathroom with him. And yet another boy with her.
