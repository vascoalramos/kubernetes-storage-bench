seuss in the West-Central region for a major study. The researchers concluded that the main factor that may have driven the development of a complex network of high power communications, and the first-generation of advanced networks to do so, is technological and cultural evolution.The results found a remarkable link between electricity generation and urbanization.The paper, entitled "Municipalities that offer low capacity transmission from the central sector provide an opportunity for more connected, and cheaper, electricity through the state's grid". In the past several decades, power transmission has been increasingly connected by direct lines through the state's local grids, as well as a mix of local and state electricity delivery networks. In the past decade, one of the primary factors affecting the deployment or utilization of some new, low power, low emission services and services has been a massive increase in the number of small-scale municipal utilities. The study found that this combination of low power, high electric power and the more efficient municipal services provided by municipal utilities has led to the increase in the percentage of low-power, elevated electric energy delivered within three to four months and the increase of the proportion of low-power, elevated electricity to the state's network.By examining all of the municipal utilities' data from 2010 through 2012, the researchers identified three clusters identified for high capacity electrified utilities: the first-phase (NDP) with an average capacity of 20 kW; the second-phase (NDPC) with an average capacity of 15 kW
