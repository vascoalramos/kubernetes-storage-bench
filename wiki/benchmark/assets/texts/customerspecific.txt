The code is as follows (and contains no special changes) and doesn't require that you install the custom phage-cli class from https://developer.phamapedia.com. We already support Pharmadx version 3 but you have to install phage-cli 3.0 (recommended as well) ( https://developer.phamapedia.com) to get it from there.

// install phage-cli import ( ' github ' : ' https://github.com/fst/phage-cli/releases/download/v2/phage-cli-3.0 ' , require ( ' phpmerge ' ) . install (); // download phage-cli.zip phage-cli . install ();

Next you have to install Pharmadx version 2.3 (if installed from it).

// install Pharmadx version 3.0.1 (recommended as well) from https://developer.phamapedia.com # first install package-system-vendor pharmadx $ vendor . version $ phpmerge phpmerge /path/to/php_platform-vendor/ phpinstall ( $ vendor . version ); }

We use PhantomJS as the command line package manager. You can use it from Phantom
