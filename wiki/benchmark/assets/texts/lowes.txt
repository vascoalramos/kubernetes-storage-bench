lowes is out: If they don't like me, I can just leave.

He'll leave if I don't.

What you know of his character is beyond me. I'm not quite sure how my heart might react, but I knew it was going to get hard. I thought it would be painful being a villain and I didn't expect his presence to change my mind. A lot better. But he wasn't going to. I was going to fight for what I believed in. I'm hoping he'll be happy he didn't go down, that I am being left behind at his hands, a life with an unknown fate attached to it.

We haven't had any of those moments that the world doesn't want to see. It's only right it can be this way.
