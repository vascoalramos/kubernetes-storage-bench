usas has been one of the best coaches in college sports for years. The only thing that makes him different is he took a step at the right time -- while it's still early on his career, he believes he can coach any defense.

The Ducks don't need to do anything extra to win at Washington. Washington is now 8-6 in its last 13 home games under Coach Al Golden despite losing two straight last weekend. It's not a great feeling to lose.

The Huskies are up 3-0 at home lately after losing a big road game Saturday. The Huskies are 11-6 this season and 13-0 in the series.

With a winning record and not only could Washington be in better form this season this season, it could also be at least good enough to reach another playoff spot.

The Ducks may make a similar push at home to finish a five-game winning streak in the playoffs, but they should be able to do so for the first time since 2015 at Washington. And all they need from that is a win and a win back-to-back playoff games.

We hope Oregon fans are getting it right when they look at Thursday night's game between the Ducks and Washington.
