A lot of these are probably new to us and we have not yet explored even the smallest of those yet. The more I look through these images I get curious about the relationship between a high frequency frequency and a short amplitude. In all likelihood it is the high frequencies that do the driving while the low frequencies do some of the driving before they get off. One theory though, suggests a more plausible explanation.

The low frequencies are those that are the
