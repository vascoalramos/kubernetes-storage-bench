ncube angrily told reporters that the Trump administration's efforts to stop illegal immigration will "stop and start in earnest."


"We're starting to realize that we have a very narrow definition of who's a legal resident," said Chitre. "And it's something we've been going back and forth on for decades now."


"Now, we've had a very long fight over who's a legal resident," added Chitre. "This isn't a matter of the federal government interfering in national elections in an attempt to control where people fall based on where they came from. This is a matter of respecting human rights as well as our right to be free of discriminatory legislation that would interfere with our ability to do our job, to protect and preserve our rights, to be able to live our life free from discriminatory discrimination -- there are no exceptions."


But it will be another year before that issue will be discussed for much longer.


So far this year, Chitre says Trump has already addressed the deportation issue with a proposal to "make it clear to our country what the status quo is," which Trump has done.
