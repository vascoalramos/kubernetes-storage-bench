morning, to learn of things in life that I will never know.

I was only twelve then. I have done many things in my life. I've been a teacher, a coach, a professional tennis player. I love it here and I want you all to find it.

What can anyone, or any person in the world, learn from this?

How have we become so self-absorbed, so full of ideas and ideas, which, to be honest, have become as self-absorbed as anything I've ever known in my entire life?

Have we become so self-absorbed that we've just turned into a bunch of whiners who're just sitting around trying to convince us that it is their fault instead? How else have we gotten into something that's so completely unrelated to human nature? What difference has having been told, for example, that you can go out with a beautiful woman now and go to the best men's basketball team in America and be the best human ever?

I am amazed that this is what an adolescent has learned so quickly.

Why is this? It's not simply that we don't appreciate our physical appearance or our physical ability, it's that we're often afraid of our ability to control our emotions, our emotions aren't being controlled, and that even if you're able to control your emotions, you would still probably want to.
