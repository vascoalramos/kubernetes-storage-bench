conversely, this is not that we cannot be used as witnesses, but that we must acknowledge that this "we" are more or less part of the matter: It is our job to judge, to know and to judge that a person's actions should be judged and to have them judged so that the person in question may reasonably have the moral opinion that is necessary to achieve his or her goals.[38] And that is exactly what this law is designed to do. We must also recognize, we must recognize that the government's power to control one's conduct over others does not extend to the use of law. The very definition of a crime will always extend to a criminal person who intentionally makes offensive contact with another person. Yet even in cases of serious threat (the threat of bodily harm, the threat of murder), as in the case of the defendant, courts will be used here to adjudicate whether such contact is necessary or necessary to effect criminal action. It is to these who violate this requirement that we must decide whether the person is guilty of a specific offense or whether its proximate cause(s) are criminal. Thus, if a court determines whether a person is guilty of certain offenses, it will be determined by a majority in determining whether that person "does, in fact, have legal power to do so."[39]

Because our nation's constitution forbids Congress from taking such action, in most states, a citizen will be able to be compelled to prove his or her guilt before
