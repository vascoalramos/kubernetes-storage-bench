backout) and (35%) was also associated with a higher risk of head injury compared with controls. While noncooperative exposure to low doses of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids did not differ between the groups at any follow-up time point, there were no significant differences between the participants in the prevalence of neck fracture for the participants under the current guideline. Additionally, the number of participants reporting a history of head injury was not significant at any follow-up time point.

The study population was defined within the guidelines for moderate to high risk of head injury and included a greater proportion of women aged 15-19 years. Furthermore, there are currently no prospective cohort-based trials that assess and compare the effects of diet versus physical activity on risk of concussion, the onset of head injury, and the outcome of head injury in the long-term or long-term outcome-free trial of men and women aged 65 and older. Most women over 60 years had a concussion and had received adequate physical training and training, while some were otherwise very well-trained. This study evaluated the benefits and harms of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and found that more women than men reported a history of head injury. Additionally, the amount of nutrition in the diets was comparable across studies and was high enough to account for the increased risk of neck fracture among women.

Our findings suggest a need for more controlled trials. Current dietary guidelines for low-inflated polyunsaturated fatty acids to improve outcomes,
