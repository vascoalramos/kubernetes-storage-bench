confess that its own work is not yet ready for prime time; it does not have many sources.

"We are building the project and we are prepared to continue to do so," a spokeswoman for the company told The Daily Beast. The spokeswoman added the company is also evaluating applications and will determine if it will be ready for prime time by late summer. It is not clear how fast the new project will take.

The new prototype, which will have a 3-inch touchscreen inside a case, will be launched at a "first" time last month. The company has said it will not be able to deliver on the original budget for the project until 2018, if at all. However, the new project team, from a small team of two to four, is expected be able to start rolling out devices in mid-2017.
