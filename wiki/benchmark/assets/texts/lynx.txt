A spokesman for Hillary's campaign issued a statement late Wednesday night calling for Clinton supporters to be "truly vigilant" that their campaigns are "not taking sides," but also said that such an approach was "disingenuous."

Hillary Clinton's campaign, in a statement Wednesday night calling for Clinton supporters to be "truly vigilant" that their campaigns are "not taking sides," said that such an approach was "disingenuous." Donald Trump has called for a "rigged" vote in the election, as do other Republicans, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has expressed his wish to use his power to take the election to states that do not have an independent elector.

But Trump also said he does not know what was going on in Nevada when the vote was cast, a clear reference to Nevada's Republican Party. His campaign issued a statement saying that if Nevada's electoral college were held today instead of on March 23, 2016, it would give Republicans control of both the White House and the House of Representatives.
