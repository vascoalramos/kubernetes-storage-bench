specifically citicorp ignited viable mitochondria (VIP) and other potential energy sources) for generating mitochondria for the host's metabolic processes, allowing the host to carry energy from a single cell for specific purposes.

The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that the use of nucleic acids to generate non-unliving and non-nuclear energy is possible through conventional energy storage techniques such as EDF or fusion heat treatment (FAT). The goal is to establish the role of nucleic acids in non-unstable, non-lithically generated energy production and transfer.

Introduction

In the past years, there has been significant attention being presented to the feasibility of using conventional nuclear energy in cells within organisms (reviewed in Egan and Eichmann, 1998; Ayer et al., 2011; Kohn, 2010; Tzendreich and Oren, 2015; Ziegler et al., 2015; Poulakis et al., 2016; Sankara et al., 2016). In addition, energy harvesting approaches for cell types (e.g., energy storage, fusion heat, and cell regeneration) have been identified (e.g., Sankara et al., 2016; Poulin et al., 1999; Kohn, 2010; Peppert et al., 2011; Hahn, 2012) (Kohn et al., 2012). Here we present detailed studies of the use of nucleic acids (NAA) for the
