stayed behind, trying to figure out how to get back to the world of Pokémon GO. It's a very strange experience for me.

"I have gotten better at my game. I've experienced it, too, but it doesn't always get good. I've got to be more patient, less aggressive, to be more understanding and not overanalyzing."

"It's like there's still this crazy thing going on, like you can't really pinpoint those things," he admitted. "And it doesn't always get good. It's never going to be an overnight transformation that you should have in your life, no matter where you look. I've reached higher and higher where I can't get good at it, so I've got to get better at my game, too."

However, many of his contemporaries have been making better progress. He remembers being a student at U of C in 2010, when Pokémon Go was just getting off the ground in a few more cities around Boston and he made such an impact.

"There went something special about me in Boston – that was really how I got my first foothold in this game, and I've just got to do everything the right way because I know it will work now, but first I had to learn to get to the next level."
