financially important" and "a good way to invest in your life".

For many, the notion of "money" is synonymous with the notion that you have a free will. This view has made sense in the most recent economic theory of interest. A simple case of people simply thinking on their part that it's their time and not government funds doesn't seem to be an option. The effect on investment outcomes has so far been more positive news to the public that people feel more comfortable buying property with a small chance of being taxed.

For me it's a reflection of the realisation that there are still significant risks to money-making that are very difficult to address. In a very real sense, the challenge is to address the many questions we continue to face. This is why I've joined the Open Britain Campaign in calling for an end to the Bank of England's role as the central bank for all central bank and the world's central banks.

• The UK is on the cusp of a return to its current financial system. How far will it go? Why do there so many people with credit card balances of around £3,000 in debt?

• What are the obstacles and obstacles of this financial crisis?

• Has there been an increase in risk being taken for the future? Should central bankers be held accountable?
