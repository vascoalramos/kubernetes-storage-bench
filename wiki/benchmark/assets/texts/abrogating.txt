abrogating and unpatriotic behavior is likely to be a result of a tendency toward aggression toward others."

That seems to hold true even if we look more closely at the behavior.

The pattern of behavior found, according to researchers, can be traced back to both men and women who engage in aggressive behavior.

For example, people who engage in such behavior may increase their risk of developing depression. Research has found that aggressive behavior affects depression rates even when you're only in a high-risk situation (though you may find these effects somewhat temporary).

When we look at the relationship across men and women, we see that many of these men have had even more of their aggressive behavior attributed to a tendency toward impulsivity to do so, suggesting that some women may be the ones carrying the weight. (This is a big problem, because it is difficult to find men who actively seek out and challenge their aggressors if they're already being seen as disruptive.)

Studies also show that aggressiveness towards a woman in relationships has a higher chance of triggering a cascade of negative emotions and moods that lead to a dramatic increase in physical ill health. And women on average suffer lower levels of emotional distress because more aggressive behavior takes precedence over those of men who resist.

That doesn't mean it's not possible for men to develop aggressive and nonaggressive behavior, but rather that some may develop some form of behavior that is different from one's traditional heterosexual behavior in
