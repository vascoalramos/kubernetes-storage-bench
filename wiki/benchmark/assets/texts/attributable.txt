These comments were sent by a blogger whom I have never been able to confirm. My guess is that this is how people get their ideas and the responses are mostly anonymous and there are no hard and fast rules: You could find lots of opinions and that seems to be what goes on in this subreddit - at least in comparison to the other two.

There are many of them - a few comments were from a user who is in his mid-40s and I have heard from one who is in his early 20s. He described himself as doing "well above average at work and attending to his writing."

"No problems here" - he did post some "good thoughts" but not much. I haven't seen him here many times in some years but I think the posts are always interesting.

Most comments seem to be to some extent negative; sometimes I see a group of about 400 to 500 people commenting on what is happening with the "crisis in Ukraine." Most people seem to feel like they are being silenced (i.e. this is going on too loud or at a disproportionate rate) or are being made to feel like they were somehow being unfairly silenced. I have no idea who did this to his comment but it probably involves the people there. He seemed pretty well informed about any problems that could befall this community but seemed to lose track of specific problems.
