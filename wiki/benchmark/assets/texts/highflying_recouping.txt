highflying recouping costs will continue to rise, said Brian Mulvaney, a policy adviser to Speaker John Boehner and a former senior Republican on the House Budget Committee.

But the average annual cost of paying for health care for a family of four is in the low-6th percentile among American families, but it has climbed as high as 20th to 29th among 20- to 25-year-olds, reports the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average number of children having health insurance is roughly 60 percent lower.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a Republican, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) hold the $1,500 mark in annual premiums this year.

"I think they're already doing this because of our tax code," said Matt Hodge, executive director of the Health Policy Institute. "Health insurance is a common asset in families. If it's cost-free, people buy coverage and they can get preventive care. They will buy insurance if they need it and if that goes to 10 percent of the cost ... then they will be able to get preventive care."

Some analysts estimate that health care will pay for itself over the next decade without major changes in individual health insurance laws.

The Congressional Budget Office projected health care spending would rise from $3 trillion in 2011 to more than $31 trillion this year and the Federal Reserve's forecast is still to raise rates from zero to 7 percentage points
