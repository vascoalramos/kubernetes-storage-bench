undercut retaining screws for the 2" steel wheels.

These are now very durable enough to withstand a few years in the woods.

I haven't been able to find a set of these. I've only looked at them from a distanceâ€¦so if you are interested in seeing them I'm happy to share my purchase information. As for these, you will need to find a set with your own weight and length to make them look like an awesome piece of equipment.

I'm also very happy with my purchase as they are only around $100 each.

Thanks so much for taking time out of your month and I'm sorry your order didn't arrive immediately!

Thank you Again,

Jim
