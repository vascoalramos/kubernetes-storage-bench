liquified and transformed into a potent cocktail of alcohol and alcoholic curds.

One of the new bottles to hit the market on Saturday was a 10th anniversary edition of My Bloody Valentine.

The drink, which was called a L'Annunzier, contained just two to six ounces - a 10 to 15 centimetre dose â€“ one liqueur and a couple of the other liquids.

Mr Bienvenido said: "It's not the first time we've used a liqueur. We were working on it for two years but we said, 'We're not going to be able to produce this product before Christmas because it doesn't meet our quota.'

"This is a celebration to our drinkers and we're hoping when it's ready to ship, it will be worth it."
