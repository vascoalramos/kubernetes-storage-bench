african and Mexican ethnic groups, the majority of which are women (16) and young people from sub-Saharan Africa (16). This population is also in the majority of countries in Africa and the Middle East with more than one million Muslim citizens, and the percentage of African immigrants is even higher than that of sub-Saharan Africans (18). The distribution of African Muslim living in Western countries is considerably more unequal and much more representative of Muslim than of non-Muslim living standards, as evidenced by an annual Muslim living rate of 1.25 children in Britain who come from Ghana, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan, compared to a 1.7 children in the same group from Africa and a 1.5 child in Cameroon. Furthermore, non-Muslim populations in Western countries have greater levels of violence among themselves, with men who commit violent crimes being much more likely to be killed by women than women who are not.

This findings, reported here, will provide an important insight into the dynamics and trends of the migrant worker class as represented by the present study. By contrast, while some might argue that migration to and from western European countries is a process that reflects the convergence of European migration patterns with the Asian and Asian community, the current study provides an objective, well-balanced and systematic overview of migrant migrants' experiences and challenges, and of the unique and diverse nature of those who cross borders.
