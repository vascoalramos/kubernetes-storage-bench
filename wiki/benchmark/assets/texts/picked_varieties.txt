picked varieties and I never had a problem with picking their fruit. However, in China, you can obtain them under different types of cultivars which make it difficult to pick them. We tried several cultivars under the same name, some cultivars looked more natural and more suitable. Some were more herbal with fruity floral undertone and some were less herbal. Other cultivars are known as "glorious" by others. Therefore, there was a different quality of the ones we sought, we are in regular contact with our cultivars and their plants, so if you still want those of any style, we will definitely discuss it with you.

What about in Taiwan and in China? What's the best cultivar from China?

In Taiwan, cultivars are a very good choice with their freshness and aromatic character. This is the same for Chinese, so if you want a fresh product that is different and is a bit more traditional, we will get rid of you without any problems. If you want to buy the same cultivar again, we will get a fresh alternative with an even more traditional flavor. Chinese, like everyone in our world, has great things to think and it seems that they would like to grow those in Taiwan which is just slightly different from our own.
