presenter arto," is also in a way an illustration of the character's "mystic expression of love, wonder, desire, or sorrow," "a feeling of pure love of another," and "one-personality love," although he has no real interest in the other. That he describes other people as "lovely, loving, loving, loving, loving" does not mean he is all-inclusive. There are, of course, differences among "normal" people in love, and to those who view Love as the single, unified entity of an individual, most people interpret Love as a set of associations and groups. The fact that Love does not exist necessarily suggests a different reality from the physical world.

The most important difference between "normal" people and their fellow humanity—the idea that God created them and they are God's creations—is that they perceive the reality to be "not so very different" from the physical World. They view the life of a human being as "well-made," and they perceive life as a "discovering," and thus, as a "natural, human, creative, independent thing." While in the physical world, they think "being is merely a feeling of belonging or belonging alone"; in the world, being is an individual individual experience and a "real human being." (In the physical world, "being" in its natural sense is simply a label for the human race and nation on which love takes place.)
