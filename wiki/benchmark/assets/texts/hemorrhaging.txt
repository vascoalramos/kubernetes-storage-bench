hemorrhaging. This is when the body begins to "buzz and have a few more seconds to recover." This is called hyperemesis and has several important differences from the actual clinical description. First, hyperemesis is a condition of hyperhydrodysplasia of the stomach and intestines. The digestive system is divided into four components: stomach, intestines, and pustules. In general the digestive system is comprised of digestive epithelial and gland-like structures such as the stomach, intestines, and the pustules. Inflammation occurs when excess blood occurs in the gums. However, in cases of increased stress and/or chronic illness during or after the event, the gut becomes more sensitive to the immune system. This sensitivity of the immune system to attack is thought to be related to insulin resistance which results in a high risk of developing inflammation in the body. A second difference is the increase in body lipid reserves and triglycerides after a specific time interval. In the absence of a hyperglucose intolerance, the blood levels of glucose decrease even when the body's metabolic rate is not normal. Third, hyperglucose intolerance is a condition of increased blood sugar levels. During hyperglycemia of the heart, the pancreas reduces its glucose uptake rate to avoid potentially dangerous hypoglycemia and ultimately triggers heart attack. This can lead to blood sugar and insulin resistance. Finally, hypoglycemia of the heart causes hypoxia
