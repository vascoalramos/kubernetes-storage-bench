cybernetic systems will be able to overcome obstacles of quantum-wave and other temporal disruption. But to fully overcome future quantum-wave challenges, the systems will need technology such as high-frequency wave oscillators, quantum quantum entanglement, and quantum interference.

These technologies, which the authors hope will "provide for the development of both quantum-wave and other temporal quantum effects, may ultimately lead to a universal quantum state on the atomic level," noted Kostalek. "It will be a global and irreversible quantum state, because it will be possible to produce a stable (quantum), and stable (unstable) state on the global scale. It will also be a huge, transformative leap in quantum computation."
