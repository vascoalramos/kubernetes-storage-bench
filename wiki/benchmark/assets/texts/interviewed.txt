interviewed my wife and daughter, we got the results of our own investigation and, in some cases, the results of it all," she explained.

He pointed out that his wife only got pregnant when he was around 11 years old. "But it was when I was in my mid-teens that I was really on the brink of pregnancy. And he just keeps bringing that up," said Beattie.

He told me that his wife got pregnant in December when they were together. And he had been told during his pregnancy that the next month or two would be the time she would get pregnant.

Boatboy's wife told us that he even tried to kill himself a week before he died. The autopsy later stated that he didn't suffer from suicidal thoughts or mental illness, but rather had suffered from a history of substance abuse in college and even attended his local university. He also did not have a criminal record, so it would be unlikely for him to pose a threat to the safety of his unborn child.

Beattie explained that in April 2015, police took Mr. Beattie into custody for allegedly threatening to commit violence to a law enforcement officer. Mr. Beattie was also charged with four counts of attempted homicide from November 2015 through late May of this year. He has only three prior convictions.
