nec, the first member of the UPA who had been detained in the 1990s, is reported to have told the Guardian that he feared his life would suffer.

"I heard that all sorts of things had to [be] done about me before they all got out," he said. "In my mind, things were going on. But for ten years I didn't do anything. I lived because I wanted to be part of something bigger so I could be seen as a hero and a role model in the country. My friends were afraid of me, and it wasn't until the age of 25 that people would be angry at me and say, 'You're racist', but then it would all vanish by then, so I wasn't there at all."

The man is believed to have confessed to being one of several suspects in the mass rape alleged in which two women and a child were allegedly gang-raped in Naxalgarh last June. He was later brought to a Mumbai police station and bailed to appear in the Magistrate's Court. His bail application was not denied.

The two victims, who are identified only as Jitendra, 18, and Shahnani, the 18-year-old student, who allegedly committed the rapes, are now living at a refugee camp in Uttar Pradesh as they await deportation to India. This is the first time the BJP has taken so close a plea for a public inquiry.
