proposal for the first-class jet would cost £300 million, or about $16billion.

The new plan would also entail a much bigger investment, the Government says, at a budget for a total of £20billion.

The Chancellor has made clear he wants to invest as little as possible.

He has announced plans to invest £200m each year to build new engines for the Queen Elizabeth II Aircraft, including 1,600 engines, which are not in fact in the pipeline.

But the extra investment would only be on top of what the Government says is a programme of £100m over 10 years to ensure the aircraft makes it out of space.

"We have talked to a range of private partners to support the Queen with these engines, that's for sure," said Chris Hetherington, who is the Chancellor's chief executive, who is involved in the £2.5billion programme.

The new engines in question - which are more power-efficient than their predecessor - are being designed as aircraft replacement-equipped, with a total of 800 units and the first-class jets can arrive under the first contract at the end of 2014.

A Royal New Zealand Aeronautical Society spokesman confirmed there were "more questions than answers" on who will pay for them.
