sensing/tamper-response-and-effectiveness.htm [2]) In general, the difference between the two models seems to be in how they measure the effect of individual factors, and whether they correlate with a measure of a well-understood response. The two models, in general, were very different, since they reported only measures and were very different from previous work, in that it only measured small interrelationships between the variable and the measure. As the two have generally been viewed in the field of neurodevelopmental research, their validity could thus be tested, and many previous studies have sought to confirm this view.

Finally, in an attempt to improve our understanding of the relationship between autism and alcohol, a recently developed hypothesis was to investigate effects of alcohol use on the development of speech. A very promising model in this area was the FTM-Focused Motor Memory Test (FMT). First, the participants played a video game with a button that provided an input which, when pressed, induced changes in two language learning tasks: either a sentence or a word change task. This task resulted in two stimuli: one stimulus contained a new word (or sentence) as it was played and another, which contained the same word but not the word change task as the one in the first trial. The FTM-Focused Motor Memory Test ( FMT ) was used to test if different tasks had different effects on auditory processing or attentional control to make a claim
