I also used the same techniques to examine different classes of algorithms. The following are the results:

I used the following techniques to examine an array of algorithms:

In all cases of the following, the average, the worst and the average-worst performance at the end were statistically significant. The same was true for the test and when we compare the results between the two types, we find clearly the best algorithms. When we first consider the problem of this type (with a special kind of optimization to deal with, it is very hard to predict how it will turn out, but the data was already generated within a few minutes, which is really nice), the test results from this study are clear and useful. Here is an example:

# the problem is a function

return array(int, 3)

# an array of 10,000 items. The average,
