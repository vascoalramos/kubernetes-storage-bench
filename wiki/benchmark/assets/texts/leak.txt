Kreis-Pierce, as the name suggests, is a self-proclaimed "Christian Zionist" who is a well-known and influential right-wing blogger and columnist, who has also been cited in recent articles in the USA Today and New York Times. Kreis-Pierce was at Breitbart News this week, where he spoke out against Israeli settlements and the rise of "apartheid" in the Middle East.

He called the idea of boycotting Jewish establishments, Jewish government services, and Jewish media in Israel "an evil lie that is destroying the Jewish People's Republic of Israel!"

According to Kreis-Pierce, who does not promote Israeli Jews, the notion that it is wrong to "discriminate against" Jewish institutions and leaders in Israel is "the same thing you are doing with this entire Jewish establishment and what is being done to it is a crime!" He added,

At Breitbart-USA, we have always stood against any kind of discrimination, especially on Jewish organizations which were founded or run by Jews. We have against the right wing's smear of Israel. The problem is that the Zionist project â€” it's not about Zionism, it's about the State or the State of Israel versus, the State of Israel. It's really a lie. The only way you can get rid of Israel is by throwing people who are Jewish into Israel. You go in and tell them, "You are pro-Israel!"
