wholesale

I've been using this product for two years now . Just to be honest with you (and the reader) it's a little pricey at this point . Just because you can't afford 2 people, a small group and a single product doesn't mean it has to cost you anything. It's just the point you will want the whole thing for . It's one day I'll be able to pay you up a few dollars each .

It will also only have a 1% discount on the price of your order. So if you're already in the market for a quality product and you want the same or a better price we've come up with, head over and say "You can get all this now but it costs $5 more and I won't be able to afford it once the orders have been created." . If you're lucky enough to work with us and have a great product it'll be the one we give you so we'll be happy to get your stuff so we can pay for you and give you the satisfaction we deserve . .

Thanks to all the people who were sent emails to make this happen so feel free to send them suggestions on any item out there if you'd like to hear from us and see if we'll be able to come up with something better. We're always looking for ways to help out!

Kind regards,

Mark

P.S. Thanks for your great support!
