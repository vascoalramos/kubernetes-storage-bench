The ceremony at D.C. Catholic Cemetery, an estimated 1,600 feet by 500 feet, is the culmination of over 60 years of remembrance.

The two women and the third woman were buried under the shade of the C.I.A.'s Casket of Life, according to an announcement the church posted online.

"There will no longer be an official burial service for our beloved D.C. Catholic ladies," reads the statement by Pope Francis, on his first day in office, before departing to spend the evening with the other women and their families. The C.I.A. has confirmed they will be cremated.

The woman who did not want any further comment was listed as Sandra Bland. In late April, Bland was sentenced to 50 years in prison for allegedly beating her girlfriend, according to federal testimony.
