popular cancellation was a major blow to their morale. They were now facing a barrage of online attacks for saying they might boycott the party. Even their own party management has had to admit that they should have been more careful. A survey of 15,000 men by Business Insider in January showed that, according to the survey, 86 percent of respondents said they are "very concerned" about the election result. "The idea that a party's popularity is determined by the people who support it does not sit right with them," says Zephyr.

As for the pollsters, they admit that their results are quite skewed due to the fact that they have no way of really knowing how much impact the results have. "It is only during the campaign," says Zephyr in a telephone message over email. "Because the only possible predictor of the actual election outcome is the election results by the candidate in question, we think the outcome will ultimately determine the outcome."

Indeed, the pollsters themselves suggest that more than 90 percent of the voters in support of President Obama did actually vote in the 2012 presidential election. And they're talking a bit in detail in this email:

I am pleased to present an estimate of the number of American voters who have voted Republican or Democrat, as determined by a poll conducted by the Washington Post. The margin of error for the results is .5 percentage points. This suggests that over half (47 percent) of respondents will vote for either party.
