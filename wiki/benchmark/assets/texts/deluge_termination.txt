"As usual, the U.N. Security Council condemns in particular the incitement and violence by the Yemeni government," he said.

US President Barack Obama called the report as "highly disturbing."

"President Obama expresses his firm belief that the war in Yemen must stop immediately, in order to protect human rights and peace, for the people of Yemen and all others. We condemn terrorism with the same urgency as we condemn the incitement and violence and the grave threat of violence," Obama said.

On Monday, after failing to clear the Yemenis of any wrongdoing that took place before their arrest, Mr Obama said he understood people's disappointment on the issue.

Kerry called last week for "political reconciliation" of the country's political prisoners, the victims' bodies and the local law enforcement to carry out the necessary checks.

"The United States urges all parties in favour of political settlement in Yemen as a matter of urgency to try to restore all parties' lives and civil rights to them," Kerry said.
