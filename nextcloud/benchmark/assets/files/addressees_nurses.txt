addressees nurses, and a group of doctors from New York City have been pushing that "one in every three American nurses in the United States will have to undergo surgery." It is a huge blow to the nation's already slow-growing health care system. In 2012, more than 18 million people were working, most of them in the private sector, in health care. The Obama administration has vowed to eliminate that figure by the end of the year. It is also putting up funding for what should be a new, more universal health care system based on an effective policy. The Obama administration and its supporters are fighting to be included among this new kind of system, even if it is far from clear that those who can still pay will be better served.
