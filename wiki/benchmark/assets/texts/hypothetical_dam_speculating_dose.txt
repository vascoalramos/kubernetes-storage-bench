hypothetical dam speculating dose. (Tropical dioxin-like compounds cause an increasing number of toxic compounds to enter respiratory and liver tissue, while monoclonal antibodies decrease hepatic blood levels of amyloid, acetyl, ascorbic acid and other pro-oxidants.) But the case studies demonstrate the power of these compounds. The highest levels of the compounds present in the oral form and the smallest doses have been observed in humans, although in the case of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), only the highest dose appears to be lethal with a dose of 100 mg and in rats. (Brominated diphenyl ether is an active neurotoxin but can induce seizures without severe toxicity.) However, the drug's potential for self-injury is unclear (see below for details).

If the chemical is in its natural state and is not a neurotoxin, it probably does not pose a danger to human health. The toxicological evidence indicates that PBDE may pose less concern to health workers than are other pesticides or toxins of the same class, although a recent review of toxicological studies indicates that these may differ. In the case in which toxicity is a risk for humans with an active neurotoxin (i.e., the potential for self-injury), the risk arises from potential exposure.

In the case of PBDE, the drug does not pose a risk for health workers that might not be a potential
