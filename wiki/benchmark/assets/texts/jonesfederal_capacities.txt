The ACLU was not involved in this case despite a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Court declined to stay that decision and allowed the district court to decide with the state. The court also granted appeal to the District Court or the district court or the district court.

The ACLU is a plaintiff in three lawsuits filed recently against the U.S. Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act.

All three plaintiffs were represented by Mary Ann Zimring, Michael J. Zimring, and Susan J. Zimring. Three plaintiffs, all of whom are U.S. citizens, were appointed by the state to represent them on the individual basis, and all of whom have been confirmed to represent the plaintiffs by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The first is a $25,000-equitable donation to the ACLU for a campaign to get Zimring's name and other court records corrected and restored on the website of the ACLU. For the other three, an online petition by local ACLU leaders is necessary.

More than four thousand people have signed the petition.
