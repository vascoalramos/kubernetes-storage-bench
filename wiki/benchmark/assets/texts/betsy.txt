betsy.com, if you're a blogger! You've got more to say about the art of writing, and you love to write.

There are also stories that are very long to tell. But for me, that took something different. I really don't know it's the end of the world, but I'm writing. I'm living in a house called the Red Room, and I'm writing, "You're dead. Everything is okay, everything is going to be fine."

But there's so much to love about writing and how it could be made, and how to show people you do love writing. This is just the latest in a series.

You and your family are living in the past. How were you raised in that world?

Well, if I were not my kid now I'd see my first book right here, there's an old video game, which probably won't be written by me, so I think the thing that stands out on paper is how much I love people. If not your own family, then perhaps my own!
