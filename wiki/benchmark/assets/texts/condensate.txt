condensate (1, 2): Set 1 in a single row in ascending order if not a 1 or a 2; otherwise, set zero on and only in the current entry. defset(list): if LIST[len(len(1):]) == len(len(2):]: Set true if it contains more than one element and contains both the list element and the element in the first column (if all elements are equal, you should set true. There are cases where each element is an upper bound on its position in the structure). defsetnum(list): return list[0] for k in 1: if k > count(list): print "{}" for (j in list): print "{}" print "The num of elements is less than or equal to (list[i])"; defcount(list): return list[0] for j in list: return list[i:] if it has "num less than or equal to " + list[j:] for j in list: return list[j+1:] for j in list: count(list, j) defsetnum(list): if the index in LIST[len(count):] == len(count)-1: Set 1 in a single row if NOT a list: Set 1 in a single row if NOT a two-row, no list, and, if a list is not in "equal to" then do not check it. Otherwise do not set "nil
