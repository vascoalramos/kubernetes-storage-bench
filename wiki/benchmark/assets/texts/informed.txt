informed, you should use a single text and try to figure out a way out for yourself. We have found that many people don't know how to use multiple words, so it will take some practice, but you can always use the text that comes to your mind and then remember which word will make sense. Even in the right place, one word or the other can make the difference between life and death. When the text works really well because you are not stuck with one word but two, it will be a much more useful choice as to what will really make you happy and in which direction life will end.

We encourage you to share what you've learned by using our personal guide, using a mobile app or use the free webinar or book by Susan M. Trowbridge when you need help connecting to your community in order to become more informed and more active.

You can follow us from the website or follow us on Facebook & Twitter! We are committed to providing informative, well-organized talks. If you see something relevant, we recommend sharing your book or app, which will help you get more to understand the topics you may be interested in. Don't forget to bring some of our other topics for a better experience!
