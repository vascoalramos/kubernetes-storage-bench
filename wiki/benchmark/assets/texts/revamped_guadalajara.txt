revamped guadalajara on the river of the Philippines in 2003," the report said. "In June 2009, as part of a security plan to bolster a counterinsurgency strategy to confront ISIL, a large swath of areas along the river's banks are reduced to rubble and a large portion of the city is abandoned."

The military had already given ISIL training facilities, an array of tanks and artillery and a command center, but it was also clear that they saw something far brighter â€“ the creation of new military camps for new recruits, possibly with the assistance from local tribal fighters.

The report added: "Many of the large military camps have been constructed with minimal input from the government's ground forces."

Officials confirmed that the military camp at Chitawi River was destroyed.

"By the time we could confirm this, the plan of the military military camps had changed into something more like real life," the military commander of Sulu province said.

"By the time I learned this, I realized that those who had been given training during the two-and-a-half-year-long ISIL operation to train and support will never reach the areas of Raqqa."
