[2021-06-02 16:53:14,984] cloud50/WARNING/locust.main: System open file limit '1024' is below minimum setting '10000'. It's not high enough for load testing, and the OS didn't allow locust to increase it by itself. See https://github.com/locustio/locust/wiki/Installation#increasing-maximum-number-of-open-files-limit for more info.
