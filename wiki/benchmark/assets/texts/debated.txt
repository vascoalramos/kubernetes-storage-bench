debated the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman argued at the time that the state's gay marriage law violated the federal ban and the federal constitutional rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

"The state has made sure that everyone and their mother and grandmother has access to equal, affordable and effective insurance coverage," his statement said.

The ACLU filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York in November 2012.

In December, Mr. Schneiderman said same-sex couples in New York could get coverage for any amount of health insurance they choose on their insurance plans. The lawsuit contended that health care providers who refused to provide such coverage were being penalized, not allowing for the same-sex couples to obtain the same coverage themselves.

Mr. Schneiderman's statement said: "While many New Yorkers do feel that their government has placed tremendous effort into supporting some of their state's most vulnerable individuals and groups, the fact is that they face a devastating reality with health costs and benefits skyrocketing to meet the huge demand for it!"
